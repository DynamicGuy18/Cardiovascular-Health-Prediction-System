#Cardiovascular Health Prediction System
Our machine learning system empowers precise cardiovascular health risk prediction through advanced data science and engineering. Using a comprehensive dataset encompassing vital health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and clinical factors, we forecast an individual's susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. Our predictive model is the result of meticulous craftsmanship and rigorous testing via a robust data analysis pipeline.
